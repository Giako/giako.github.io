{"name":"Giako's space","tagline":"I'm in spaaaaaaace!","body":"### Welcome to my space.\r\nHi, my name is Giacomo \"@Giako\" Russo.\r\nI'm an Italian geek who loves programming, GNU/Linux and videogames (on Linux). In my free time, I listen to trance music, dubstep and indie EDM and I love American TV series (I'm a huge Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones fan!).\r\n\r\n## What I do at day\r\n* I code, develop, design, build, test for a living at [Reply](http://www.reply.eu/), in Milan (IT). I'm an IT consultant with a focus on Enterprise Architectures.\r\n* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)\r\n\r\n## What I do at night\r\n* I keep my laptop up-to-date :) Long time Ubuntu user here, since 2004.\r\n* I keep my phone and tablet up-to-date. I'm an Android user, but I look with interest also Ubuntu, Jolla, Tizen phones.\r\n* I keep myself up-to-date with the latest trends in programming: from software engineering to Java, from container technology to front-end development.\r\n* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)\r\n\r\nI'm a very curious person. My main languages are Java and Javascript, but I'm making space for other languages, such as Ruby, Clojure, LISP and so on.\r\nI'm a big supporter of Agile and DevOps practices and I'm trying to perfect my skills not only in Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also in Ansible and Docker usage.\r\n\r\n### Find me on...\r\n[Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/giako)\r\n[Onename.com](https://onename.com/giako)\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Giako87)","google":"UA-35688604-2","note":"Don't delete this file!

# Welcome to my space.

Hi, my name is Giacomo "@Giako" Russo.
I'm an Italian geek who loves programming, GNU/Linux and indie videogames (on Linux and on my [Steam Deck](https://www.steamdeck.com/). In my free time, I listen to trance music, I play board games (especially German ones) and I am a Formula 1 geek.

## What I do at day

* I code, develop, design, build, test and manage teams for a living at [Stentle](http://www.stentle.com/), remotely from Lecce (IT).
* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)

## What I do at night

* I keep my laptop up-to-date :) Long time Ubuntu user here, since 2004.
* I keep my phone and tablet up-to-date. I'm an Android user.
* I keep myself up-to-date with the latest trends in programming: from software engineering to Java, from container technology to blockchain technology.
* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)

I'm a very curious person. My main languages are Java, Go and Javascript, but I'm making room for other languages, such Clojure and Lisps.
I'm a big supporter of DevOps practices and I'm a big user and fan of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

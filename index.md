### Welcome to my space.
Hi, my name is Giacomo "@Giako" Russo.
I'm an Italian geek who loves programming, GNU/Linux and videogames (on Linux). In my free time, I listen to trance music, dubstep and indie EDM and I love American TV series (I'm a huge Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones fan!).

## What I do at day
* I code, develop, design, build, test and manage teams for a living at [Stentle](http://www.stentle.com/), in Milan (IT). I'm an IT consultant with a focus on Enterprise Architectures.
* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)

## What I do at night
* I keep my laptop up-to-date :) Long time Ubuntu user here, since 2004.
* I keep my phone and tablet up-to-date. I'm an Android user.
* I keep myself up-to-date with the latest trends in programming: from software engineering to Java, from container technology to blockchain technology.
* Drink coffee (Italian Espresso only!)

I'm a very curious person. My main languages are Java and Javascript, but I'm making space for other languages, such as Ruby, Clojure, LISP.
I'm a big supporter of Agile and DevOps practices and I'm trying to perfect my skills not only in Continuous Integration and Delivery, but also in Ansible and Docker usage.
